## More S'mores

More S'mores is a clone of the camping app HipCamp. More S'mores allows users to find camp and reserve camping sites. Additionally users can place their own property as camp sites and control reservations to their camp sites. Every site lists their various amenities such as allowing pets or to park an RV, enabling users to search and find camp sites by their preference.
